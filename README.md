# CMPVoD-A-cluster-mesh-based-architecture-for-VoD-streaming-over-hybrid-CDN-P2P-networks
CMPVoD is a new cluster mesh-based architecture for hybrid CDN-P2P VoD streaming with VCR functions. We evaluate CMPVoD to achieve trade-off between quality of service and server load stress. In CMPVOD, peers are organized in clusters, based on their playback points.
